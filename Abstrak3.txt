Physical distancing is one way to prevent the spread of the virus in public places. The implementation of physical distance restrictions requires supervision to be successful as expected. Supervision that is carried out manually, especially in places with high levels of crowds, is less effective because it requires many officers at the location which will actually increase the crowd.In  this  study,  a  prototype  monitoring  system  for  physical  distance  restrictions  was developed by utilizing CCTV cameras with digital image processing based on computer vision and deep learning. The method used is a combination of detection and tracking of pedestrians with YOLOv4 and DeepSORT. Trigonometric methods are used in the distance estimation process to detect violations of distance restrictions by pedestrians. In this study, the test results obtained with the best recall value 0.86; precision 0.69 and mean average precision (mAP) of 0.83 with the YOLOv4 transfer learning model training method with a maximum batch of 6000 using 473 training  data  and  119  validation  data.  The  entire  system  achieves  an  average  real-time processing speed of 24to 26FPS.
