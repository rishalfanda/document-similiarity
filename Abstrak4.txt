The Ministry of Transportation reported a 4.30% increase in the number of motorized vehicles in Indonesia in 2021, making the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system increasingly  important  for  traffic  management.  However,  implementing  ANPR  in  different weather  conditions  is  challenging.  To  address  this  issue,  a  study  used  two  deep  learning modules, YOLOv5n for license plate detection and the TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-Attn framework for character  recognition.  Each  module  was  trained  with  two  types  of  datasets,  Dataset  1,  which included images with variations in sunny and cloudy weather conditions, and Dataset 2, which included images with variations in sunny, cloudy, and moderate rainy weather conditions. The best-performing  training  method  for  the  YOLOv5n  model  was  using  Dataset 2and evolutionhyperparameters,  with  a  testing  result  of  mAP  0.893and  f1-score  0.887.  The  best-performing training method for the TRBA framework was using Dataset 2 (3200 data), with a testing result of  83.08%  accuracy.  The  ANPR  system  has  various  applications  in  sectors  such  as  command forces, parking  management,  and  road  safety.  The  combination  of  object  detection  and character  recognition  allows  for  the  development  of  an  end-to-end  AI  solution  for  automatic license plate recognition
