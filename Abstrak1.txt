Welding inspection is an absolute necessity for the industrial world, especially those engaged in the automotive sector to ensure weld quality. However, most industries still use manual inspection which is subjective and full of bias which can result in inconsistencies in the assessment of quality standards. Therefore, intelligent system that can check the quality of welding consistently is needed. This study aims to create an artificial intelligence model based on deep learning and computer vision to detect welding spots and classify them into good and bad categories. CNN model with UNet architecture is adopted to perform image segmentation on iron welding images. Studies using several feature extraction techniques are also conducted to obtain the best model performance based on IoU scores and model convergence speed. Based on the experimental results, the UNet technique is proven to be able to improve the performance of the model with an IoU score of 78.1% and with a convergence speed of 144 epochs.
